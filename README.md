# PoetryAnalysisNLP

This project investigates various properties of poetry, such as style, rhyme, emotion, and sentiment, using NLP techniques. With Python's NLTK, SentiWordNet, EmoTag1200, and other relevant libraries, this analysis demonstrates the ability to handle complex linguistic features and big data embeddings in a structured manner.

## Project Structure

The project contains 10 tasks, each focused on a distinct aspect of poetry analysis:

1. **POS Tagging** - Analyze the distribution of parts of speech in each line.
2. **Frequent Terms** - Identify and visualize the 30 most frequent terms with their positions.
3. **Repetitions** - Calculate the frequency and distribution of repetitions within lines and between successive lines.
4. **Named Entity Recognition** - Identify and analyze entities such as persons, organizations, and locations.
5. **Emotion Analysis** - Use EmoTag1200 to map lexicon terms to a 2D emotional space.
6. **Line-based Emotion Analysis** - Sum lexicon term scores for each line to explore aggregate emotions.
7. **Sentiment Analysis** - Compute and plot sentiment distribution using SentiWordNet.
8. **Emotion by Location** - Explore the sentiment and emotion in proximity to key location entities.
9. **Rhyme and Syllable Structure** - Identify rhyme patterns and analyze syllable distribution.
10. **Discussion** - Summarize findings, discuss limitations, and propose areas for improvement.

### Prerequisites
